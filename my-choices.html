<h2>Site Description</h2>
<p>The overall site is a social media site aimed towards allowing users to easily create and interact with posts.
    Taking inspiration from Reddit, the site aims to have a simple and easy to use interface. Users are able to create
    accounts that will allow them to create posts and add comments to existing posts. All posts are displayed on the index 
    page in order of date posted. Users have the ability to sort their feed via their attributes (ie. oldest). Those that have 
    admin permissions are able to manage any post as well as create special posts. Special posts are treated differently
    than other posts and will always be placed ontop of the feed as the first thing users see, and are visually different.
    The more technical aspects of the site are done via JavaScript to help make the page more responsive and to perform 
    certain operations in the background while the user navigates the site. For example, the rating buttons are all handled
    via AJAX calls to update the database and then pull the updated value into the HTML page. Furthermore, most aspects that
    were prevously handled via rudimentary form responses now utilize event handlers and function calls to make the site
    overall more efficient.
